# Amazon VPC Lattice - Example: Service Associations

This example shows how you can use the VPC Lattice module to create Service Associations to an existing Service Network (created in a separate call of the VPC Lattice module). In the `outputs.tf` file, you can see an example on how to obtain the Services information (ID, DNS name, and Service Association ID).
