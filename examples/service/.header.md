# Amazon VPC Lattice - Example: Service creation

This example shows how you can use the VPC Lattice module to only create a Service - without the creation of a Service Network. In the Service, the example also creates the following:

* 2 Listeners (HTTP and HTTPS).
* The HTTP listener has a *fixed-response* as default action, and two Listener Rules (*path_match* and *headers_match*).
* The HTTPS listener has a *forward* as default action.
* Three target groups (1 Instance and 2 Lambda types) without targets.

In the `outputs.tf` file, you can see an example on how to obtain the Service Network information (DNS name, Service ID, and Listeners IDs).
