# Amazon VPC Lattice Module

This module can be used to deploy resources from [Amazon VPC Lattice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/what-is-vpc-service-network.html). VPC Lattice is a fully managed application networking service that you use to connect, secure, and monitor all your services across multiple accounts and virtual private clouds (VPCs).

This module handles all the different resources you can use with VPC Lattice: Service Network, Service, Listeners, Listener Rules, Target Groups (and targets), and Associations (Service or VPC). You have the freedom to create the combination of resources you need, so in multi-AWS Account environments you can make use of the module as many times as needed (different providers) to create your application network architecture.

## VPC Lattice service network (var.service_network)

A [VPC Lattice service network](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/service-networks.html) is a logical boundary for a collection of services. It is the central place of connectivity where consumers (located in a VPC) and producers (target groups) are connected to allow service consumption. In addition, it provides a central place for access control via [IAM auth policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/auth-policies.html), and visibility by enabling [logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/monitoring-access-logs.html).

When creating a service network in the module, the following attributes are expected:

- `name`        = (Optional|string) VPC Lattice service network name. This attribute creates a **new** service network using the specified name. **This attribute and `identifier` cannot be set at the same time.**
- `auth_type`   = (Optional|string) Type of IAM policy to apply in the service network. Allowed values are `NONE` (default) and `AWS_IAM`.
- `auth_policy` = (Optional|any) Auth policy. The policy string in JSON must not contain newlines or blank lines. The auth policy resource will be created only if `auth_type` is set to `AWS_IAM`.
- `identifier`  = (Optional|string) The ID or ARN of an **existing** service network. If you are working in multi-AWS account environments, ARN is compulsory. **This attribute and `name` cannot be set at the same time.**

You can share VPC Lattice service networks using AWS RAM with this module. Check the section [Sharing VPC Lattice resources](#sharing-vpc-lattice-resources) for more information.

**Examples** of use can be found in the [/examples/service_network](./examples/service_network/) folder.

### VPC associations (var.vpc_associations)

When you associate a VPC with a service network, it enables all the resources within that VPC to be clients and communicate with other services associated to that same service network. You can make use of Security Groups to control the access of the VPC association, allowing some traffic segmentation before the traffic arrives to the Service Network.

You can create more than 1 VPC association with this module, as this variable expects a map of objects with the following attributes:

- `vpc_id`             = (string) ID of the VPC.
- `security_group_ids` = (Optional|list(string)) List of Security Group IDs to associate with the VPC association.

## VPC Lattice service (var.services)

A [VPC Lattice service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/services.html) is an independently deployable unit of software that delivers a specific task or function. It can run on instances, containers, or as serverless functions within an AWS Account or a VPC. A service has a [listener](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/listeners.html) that uses **rules** you can configure to help route traffic to your targets.

### VPC Lattice service associations

When a VPC Lattice service network is created or referenced using the module, a [VPC Lattice service association](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/service-associations.html) is created automatically for each VPC Lattice service created/referenced in the module.

**Examples** of use can be found in the [/examples/ram_share](./examples/ram_share/) folder.

## Amazon Route 53 DNS configuration

VPC Lattice leverages [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/what-is-dns/) for service discovery, so each VPC Lattice service is easily identifiable through its service-managed or custom domain names. When a new Amazon VPC Lattice service is created, a service-managed domain name is generated. This domain name is publicly resolvable and resolves either to an IPv4 link-local address or an IPv6 unique-local address. So, a consumer application using this service-managed domain name does not require any extra DNS configuration for the service-to-service communication (provided the VPC Lattice configuration allows connectivity). However, it’s more likely that you will use your own custom domain names.

When using custom domain names for Amazon VPC Lattice services, an [alias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html) (for Amazon Route 53 hosted zones) have to be created to map the custom domain name with the service-managed domain name. In multi-service environments, the creation of the DNS resolution configuration can create heavy operational overhead.

This module supports the creation of alias records (both A and AAAA) in Route 53 hosted zones specified in two locations:

* By using the variable `var.dns_configuration` (Optional|map(string)), you can specify a "global" hosted zone ID (attribute `hosted_zone_id`) to configure the Alias record of each VPC Lattice service created/referenced with a custom domain name configured.
* By using the attribute `hosted_zone_id` under each VPC Lattice service configured (`var.services`) you can create the Alias record for the provided Hosted Zone ID only for that specific service.
* A Hosted Zone ID referenced in a service definition overrides the configuration done in `var.dns_configuration`.

**The module only supports the DNS configuration if the Hosted Zone and VPC Lattice service are in the same AWS Account**. For multi-Account environments, please check the [Guidance for Amazon VPC Lattice Automated DNS Configuration on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/amazon-vpc-lattice-automated-dns-configuration-on-aws/). This Guidance Solution follows an event-driven architecture to communicate AWS Accounts and configure DNS records when Hosted Zones and VPC Lattice services are in different AWS Accounts.

**Examples** of use can be found in the [/examples/dns_configuration](./examples/dns_configuration/) folder.
